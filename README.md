# Goodreads Kitap Koala Hook

It's a Chrome extension that adds a button to Goodreads' book detail page that shows the book on [Kitap Koala](https://kitapkoala.com). There is an Amazon button on the book details page to buy a copy of the related book from Amazon web site. As [goodreads](https://goodreads.com) belongs to Amazon, that is understandable. But, I decided to add another button to see and possibly buy that related book from my favorite online bookstore which is [Kitap Koala](https://kitapkoala.com).

### Why Kitap Koala

Since its establishment, it has undertaken the treatment of many animals upon application. It has undertaken the delivery of pending books, which it sells through its members, to schools and mediated the delivery of suspended foods to shelters. Therefore, I decided to buy printed books from them as much as possible. For more details, please check their [about us](https://www.kitapkoala.com/sayfa/hakkimizda) page.
